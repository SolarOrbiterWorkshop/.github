# Solar Orbiter Resources and Tools

This is a **community-driven space** to share tools, examples, and documentation for working with data from the ESA/NASA **Solar Orbiter** mission.

ðŸš€ **Explore:**
- ðŸ“š [Documentation & Example Gallery](https://solarorbiterworkshop.github.io/solar-orbiter-docs/)

There are some past tutorial repos on this page too, but the main idea is to add these to the documentation linked here. 

We welcome contributions from the community!
